 * @brief When the AMDVLK_NULL_GPU=ALL environment variable is set, this layer will provide a list of all possible
 *        NULL devices to the application. No physical device objects will be exposed to the application because there
 *        is a limit on the number of physical device objects that can be created. VkPhysicalDeviceProperties pointers
 *        are exposed through the VkPhysicalDevice handles in vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices_ND so that
 *        vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties_ND can expose the properties for the appropriate NULL device.
